1. The output of the SimpleThreadExample program generally displays two threads printing greeting messages ("Good morning!" and "Good afternoon!") in an alternating, interleaved order. Each thread prints its designated message 10 times, with each thread announcing its start and exit. But it is not always consistent

2. By adding the Thread.sleep(1000) in GreetingsThread.run() causes each message print to pause for 1 second, making the outputs appear more orderly and spaced. But it is clear that the order in which the threads start and finish changes each time we run the program. Sometimes the "Good morning!" thread starts first, while other times the "Good afternoon!" thread starts first. The same applies to the threads finishing — their exit order varies as well.

3. By adding  System.out.println("Main method exiting..."); in main it allows the main method to finish while morningThread and afternoonThread continue running in parallel. Since threads execute independently, they keep printing messages after main has exited, resulting in their output appearing on the Terminal even after main completes.

4. The main thread calls morningThread.join(5000), meaning it waits for up to 5 seconds for morningThread to finish. During this time, morningThread runs and prints "Good morning!" repeatedly. After 5 seconds have passed afternoonThread starts. There are some cases when  Good morning is being printed out after Good afternoon starts. We can say that if  morningThread does not complete within that time, afternoonThread starts regardless.

5. ``` join() ```: Blocks the calling thread until the target thread fully completes, regardless of time.
```join(10)```: Blocks for a maximum of 10 milliseconds, then resumes whether the target thread is finished or not.

6. ```isAlive()``` checks if a thread is currently running.
```join()``` pauses the calling thread until the target thread completes.

7. The order of lap completion is influenced by each animal’s sleep duration. Since Thread.sleep() is shorter for faster animals (cheetah sleeps 20 ms, hare 50 ms, and tortoise 200 ms), the cheetah finishes each lap first, followed by the hare and then the tortoise. The program runs each animal in its own thread, so they progress independently, with output interleaved based on sleep intervals and thread scheduling.

8. By introducing a delay(make it sleep) after starting the hare thread, the tortoise and cheetah begin racing late which gives the hare a head start. The 500 ms delay means the hare can complete a few laps before the other two join in, simulating a lead without altering their defined speeds. This head start, however may not prevent the faster cheetah from eventually catching up and finishing first.
```java
/* AnimalFootRace.java */
public class AnimalFootRace {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread tortoiseThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Tortoise", 5);
        Thread hareThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Hare", 20);
        Thread cheetahThread = new AnimalRacerThread("Cheetah", 50);

        System.out.println("On your marks, get set, go!");
        hareThread.start();

        try {
            Thread.sleep(500);  // 500 ms delay to give the hare a head start
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
           System.out.println("Interrupted while sleeping...");
        }

        tortoiseThread.start();
        cheetahThread.start();
    }
}
```
