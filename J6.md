1. The output of the SimpleThreadExample program generally displays two threads printing greeting messages ("Good morning!" and "Good afternoon!") in an alternating, interleaved order. Each thread prints its designated message 10 times, with each thread announcing its start and exit. But it is not always consistent

2. By adding the Thread.sleep(1000) in GreetingsThread.run() causes each message print to pause for 1 second, making the outputs appear more orderly and spaced. But it is clear that the order in which the threads start and finish changes each time we run the program. Sometimes the "Good morning!" thread starts first, while other times the "Good afternoon!" thread starts first. The same applies to the threads finishing â€” their exit order varies as well.
